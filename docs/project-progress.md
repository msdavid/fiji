## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 0: Project Setup & Core Backend Foundations
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Completion Date:** 2024-08-26
*   **Goal:** Establish the monorepo project structure, basic FastAPI application in the `backend` directory, Dockerization, initial CI/CD setup for the backend, core data models for users and roles, Firebase Authentication setup, initial user invitation/creation logic, and a robust testing framework.

*   **Key Achievements:**
    *   **Monorepo and Backend Initialization:** The project's monorepo structure was established, and the backend FastAPI application was initialized using `uv` for package management.
    *   **Firebase Integration:** Firebase Admin SDK was integrated into the backend, configured to use Application Default Credentials (ADC) for secure communication with Google Cloud services.
    *   **Core Data Models & Firestore Setup:**
        *   Pydantic models for `Role`, `Invitation`, and `User` were defined to ensure data consistency.
        *   The `roles` collection in Firestore was initialized with a `sysadmin` role using a dedicated utility script (`backend/utils/initialize_firestore.py`).
        *   The `users` and `registrationInvitations` collections are prepared for automatic creation by Firestore.
    *   **Essential API Endpoints Implemented:**
        *   A robust authentication dependency (`get_firebase_user`) was created to verify Firebase ID tokens for securing API endpoints.
        *   CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for managing `roles` were developed, with initial protection for sysadmin-only access.
        *   An API endpoint for `sysadmin` users to create registration invitations was implemented.
        *   An API endpoint to allow users to register using an invitation token (after frontend Firebase Authentication) was created, which also handles user profile creation in Firestore and role assignment.
    *   **Containerization & CI/CD Foundation:**
        *   A `Dockerfile` for the backend service was created, ensuring a reproducible build environment using `uv`.
        *   An initial `cloudbuild.yaml` was configured in the monorepo root, enabling automated builds of the backend Docker image and pushing it to Google Artifact Registry.
        *   **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline:** The `cloudbuild.yaml` was updated to include a dedicated step for running backend tests (`uv run pytest`) prior to Docker image builds. The `Dockerfile` was also updated for correct build context and `PYTHONPATH` to support testing and refactored import structures.
    *   **Backend Testing Framework & Code Quality:**
        *   Pytest framework established for comprehensive backend testing.
        *   Initial unit and integration tests developed for core API endpoints (e.g., main application, roles), with mocks implemented for Firebase Admin SDK and Firestore to ensure isolated and reliable testing.
        *   Backend Python import structures were refactored to use absolute paths, resolving potential circular dependencies and improving code maintainability. Database client initialization was moved to FastAPI's `lifespan` events for better resource management and testability.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   A `backend/README.md` was created and subsequently enhanced with detailed setup, testing, and local run instructions.
        *   All relevant SRS documents (`docs/technical-specs.md`, `.Q/Software-Requirements-Specifications.md`, `.Q/PROJECT_FIJI_LLM_SPRINT_PLAN_SRS.md`) were updated to reflect architectural decisions, backend refinements, and testing setup.
    *   **GCP Prerequisites:** User confirmed completion of manual GCP setup, including enabling Firebase services and configuring IAM permissions for ADC.

*   **Outcome:** Sprint 0 successfully established a solid foundation for the backend services. This includes core APIs, database interaction, authentication mechanisms, a robust testing framework with initial test coverage, and an enhanced CI/CD pipeline incorporating automated testing. The project is well-positioned to proceed with frontend development and further backend feature enhancements in subsequent sprints.
