Fix(events): Prevent sending extra fields in event update payload

- Modified `handleSubmit` in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/edit/page.tsx`
  to explicitly pick allowed fields for the event update payload.
- This ensures that only fields defined in the backend `EventUpdate`
  Pydantic model are sent, preventing "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors.
- Mapped frontend `formData.location` to `venue` in the payload,
  aligning with backend model expectations.
- Also updated `fetchEventData` to map backend `venue` to frontend `location`
  when populating the form.
- Added potentially extraneous fields to `EventFormData` interface for clarity,
  though they are not used in the update payload.
- Updated `.Q/projectlog.md`.
