Feat(events): Enable backend storage for event icons

- Updated Pydantic models in `backend/models/event.py` to include an
  optional `icon` field in `EventBase` and `EventUpdate`.
- This allows the `icon` string (e.g., Material Icon name) selected
  on the frontend to be saved to Firestore when creating or updating
  an event.
- No changes were needed in `backend/routers/events.py` as Pydantic's
  `model_dump()` automatically handles the inclusion of the new field.
- Updated `.Q/projectlog.md` to reflect these backend changes.
