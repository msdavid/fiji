Refactor: Update events page to use card matrix layout

The events listing page (frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx) has been
refactored to display events in a responsive card matrix, similar to the
working groups page.

Key changes:
- Replaced the list view with a `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` layout.
- Each event is now a card with `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 shadow-lg rounded-lg`.
- The entire card is a `Link` to the event detail page.
- Event title changes color on hover (`group-hover:text-indigo-600`).
- Event description is truncated to 2 lines using `line-clamp-2`.
- Card footer displays creator information and creation date.
- 'Edit' button is positioned in the card footer and uses `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent navigating to the event detail page.
- Page title style (`h1`) and 'No events found' message styling now match the working groups page for consistency.
- Added TODO comments for future privilege-based access control for creating and editing events.
