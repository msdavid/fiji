Refactor(events): Implement three-section layout for event cards

The event cards on the events listing page have been refactored to a
three-section layout:
1.  Left section: Displays a circular placeholder (calendar icon).
2.  Right section (top): Contains event details (name, type, venue, date, status, description).
3.  Right section (bottom): Shows creation metadata (creator, creation date) and the 'Edit' button.

Key changes:
-   Implemented a flexbox layout for the three sections within each card.
-   Added a placeholder SVG calendar icon in the left section.
-   Added `border-r` and `border-t` for visual separation between sections.
-   The main `Link` component now wraps the icon and details sections, making most of the card clickable.
-   The 'Edit' button uses `e.stopPropagation()` to ensure it doesn't trigger the card's navigation.
-   Adjusted padding, font sizes, and line-clamping for responsiveness (e.g., `sm:p-6`, `sm:text-xl`, `sm:line-clamp-3`).
-   Event name (`eventName`) now uses `truncate` to prevent overflow.
-   Creator's User ID is substringed (`.substring(0,8)`) for brevity on the card.
-   Added a `TODO` comment in the `Event` interface and near the icon for future implementation of dynamic event icons.
