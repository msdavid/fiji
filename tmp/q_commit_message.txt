Fix(events): Remove duplicate navbar from event detail page

The event detail page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`)
contained its own `<nav>` element, which caused a duplicate navbar when
rendered within the main dashboard layout.

This commit removes the redundant `<nav>` element from the event detail page.
The "Back to Events" link has been moved to the top of the `main` content
area, just above the event title, to maintain navigation functionality.
The outer `div` with `min-h-screen` and background styling was also removed
as these should be handled by the parent layout.
