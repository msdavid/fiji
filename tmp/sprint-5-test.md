To manually test the Sprint 5 capabilities (User Availability and Donation Tracking) via a web browser, you'll need to interact with both the frontend UI and potentially observe the backend responses or Firestore data.

Hereâ€™s a suggested testing plan:

**I. User Availability Testing**

**A. Testing User's Own Profile Availability (`/dashboard/profile`)**

1.  **Login as a Standard User.**
2.  **Navigate to Profile:** Go to `/dashboard/profile`.
3.  **View Initial Availability:**
    *   Look for the "Availability" section.
    *   Initially (if never set), "General Availability" should show "Not specified", and "Specific Dates Unavailable/Available" should show "None specified".
4.  **Edit Availability - Valid Input:**
    *   Click "Edit Profile".
    *   Find the "Edit Availability" section.
    *   **General Availability:** Enter text like "Evenings and weekends".
    *   **Specific Dates Unavailable:** Enter valid dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, comma-separated (e.g., `2024-08-15, 2024-08-20`).
    *   **Specific Dates Available:** Enter valid dates (e.g., `2024-08-17`).
    *   Click "Save Changes".
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Check for a success message.
        *   The page should return to view mode.
        *   Verify the displayed availability matches your input (dates should be nicely formatted, e.g., "Aug 15, 2024").
        *   Refresh the page: The saved availability should persist.
5.  **Edit Availability - Clearing Fields:**
    *   Click "Edit Profile" again.
    *   Clear the content of all three availability fields.
    *   Click "Save Changes".
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Displayed availability should revert to "Not specified" / "None specified".
        *   Refresh and verify persistence.
6.  **Edit Availability - Invalid Date Format:**
    *   Click "Edit Profile".
    *   In "Specific Dates Unavailable", enter an invalid date or format (e.g., `2024/12/25` or `Dec 25, 2024` or `invalid-date`).
    *   Click "Save Changes".
    *   **Verification:** An error message regarding invalid date format should appear, and the profile should not save with the invalid dates. Correct the format or remove the invalid entry to save other fields.
7.  **Backend Check (Optional):**
    *   After a successful save, you can check the user's document in the Firestore `users` collection.
    *   Look for the `availability` map field. It should contain:
        *   `general`: Your entered string.
        *   `specificDatesUnavailable`: An array of date strings (e.g., `["2024-08-15", "2024-08-20"]`).
        *   `specificDatesAvailable`: An array of date strings (e.g., `["2024-08-17"]`).

**B. Testing Admin View of User Availability (`/dashboard/admin/profile/[userId]`)**

1.  **Login as an Admin User** (with `users:view` privilege).
2.  **Navigate to User Profile:** Go to `/dashboard/admin/users`, find a user whose availability you set in step A, and click to view their profile (`/dashboard/admin/profile/[userId]`).
3.  **View Availability:**
    *   Locate the "Availability" section within the "Professional Details & Availability" card.
    *   **Verification:** The displayed availability should match what was set for that user. This page is view-only for availability.

**II. Donation Tracking Testing**

**A. Testing Recording a New Donation (`/dashboard/donations/new`)**

1.  **Login as an Admin User** (with `donations:create` and `donations:list` privileges).
2.  **Navigate to New Donation Form:**
    *   Go to `/dashboard/donations`.
    *   Click the "Record New Donation" button. This should take you to `/dashboard/donations/new`.
    *   (If the button is not visible, or direct navigation shows access denied, verify privileges).
3.  **Test Monetary Donation:**
    *   **Donor Name:** Enter "Test Donor Inc."
    *   **Donation Date:** Select a date.
    *   **Donation Type:** Ensure "Monetary" is selected.
    *   **Amount & Currency:**
        *   Try submitting with empty Amount or Currency: Verify error messages.
        *   Enter Amount: `100`, Currency: `SGD`.
    *   **Description:** Enter "Monetary contribution for general funds".
    *   Click "Record Donation".
    *   **Verification:**
        *   A success message should appear.
        *   You should be redirected to the `/dashboard/donations` list page after a short delay.
4.  **Test In-Kind Donation:**
    *   Navigate back to `/dashboard/donations/new`.
    *   **Donor Name:** Enter "Kind Giver".
    *   **Donation Date:** Select a date.
    *   **Donation Type:** Select "In-Kind".
    *   **Verification:** Amount and Currency fields should disappear or become non-applicable.
    *   **Description:** Enter "Donated 5 laptops". (Try submitting without description: verify error).
    *   Click "Record Donation".
    *   **Verification:** Success and redirection.
5.  **Backend Check (Optional):**
    *   Check the `donations` collection in Firestore.
    *   Verify new documents exist for the recorded donations.
    *   Check fields like `donorName`, `donationType`, `amount`, `currency`, `description`, `donationDate`, and `recordedByUserId` (should be your admin user's UID).

**B. Testing Donations List (`/dashboard/donations`)**

1.  **Login as an Admin User** (with `donations:list` privilege).
2.  **Navigate to Donations List:** Go to `/dashboard/donations`.
3.  **View Donations:**
    *   **Verification:** The donations you recorded should appear in the table.
    *   Check if all columns display correctly: Date, Donor, Type, Amount/Details (e.g., "100.00 SGD" for monetary, or the description for in-kind), Recorded By.
    *   If no donations exist, a "No donations recorded yet" message should appear.
4.  **View Link (Placeholder):**
    *   Click the "View" link for any donation. This should navigate to `/dashboard/donations/[donationId]`. Since this page isn't fully implemented yet, you might see a 404 or a basic placeholder page if one was created.

**General Checks:**
*   Ensure all forms are styled with Tailwind UI as expected.
*   Check for console errors in the browser's developer tools during these operations.

This plan should help you thoroughly test the new Sprint 5 features. Remember to adjust user roles and privileges in Firestore if you are testing with non-sysadmin users.
