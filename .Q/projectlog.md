    *   Updated frontend event detail page (`[eventId]/page.tsx`) to display full names for creator and organizer.
    *   Corrected `SyntaxError` in `backend/routers/events.py` and refined async calls in `_get_user_details`.
*   **Organizer Search Functionality (Phase 3):**
    *   Backend:
        *   Defined `UserSearchResult` model in `backend/models/user.py`.
