# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Remove the styled container ("box") from behind the search and filter controls on the Events page.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed `events/page.tsx`:** Identified the `div` element with classes `mb-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6` that was acting as the container for the search and filter inputs.
2.  **Modified `events/page.tsx`:**
    *   Removed the aforementioned `div` element.
    *   The inner `div` with classes `mb-6 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` (which was previously a child) is now the direct container for the search and filter inputs, placing them directly on the page's main background. The `mb-6` class was retained on this grid container to maintain spacing.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Beautify the Events page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Refined Page Structure and Overall Layout:**
    *   Removed the redundant `<main>` tag from `events/page.tsx` as `DashboardLayout` provides it.
    *   Ensured the primary `div` in `events/page.tsx` acts as the direct content container.
    *   Adjusted the event card Link to use `flex-col` for its main layout and an inner `flex-row` for the icon and text content, with the metadata footer moved to be a direct child of the main `Link` component to ensure it's always at the bottom of the card.

2.  **Enhanced Header and Controls:**
    *   Added a Material Icon (`add_circle_outline`) to the "Create New Event" button.
    *   Updated the button's classes to `py-2 px-4 bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm inline-flex items-center` to align with the styling guide.
    *   Wrapped the search input and status filter in a styled container: `div className="mb-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6"`.

3.  **Improved Event Card Visuals:**
    *   Adjusted status badge padding on event cards from `py-0.5` to `py-1` (with existing `px-2`) to better align with the `px-2.5 py-1` guide suggestion for `Status Badges`.

4.  **Enhanced Loading and Empty States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Replaced simple text with a Material Icon (`sync`) with `animate-spin`, centered with improved text: `div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center h-full min-h-[300px]"`.
    *   **Empty State:** Added a Material Icon (`event_busy`) to the "No events found" message container. Enhanced container styling with `shadow-lg` and `flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-[200px]`. Improved text presentation with larger font for the main message and styled "create one now" link.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency with the styling guide and overall visual appeal.
    *   Confirmed input field padding (`p-3`) aligns with the guide.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`
