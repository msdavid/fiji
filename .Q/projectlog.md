## Session (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
**Goal**: Change "Display Name" to "Full Name" in Users Report.

**Summary**:
Updated the Users Report to display a "Full Name" column, constructed from `firstName` and `lastName` fields, instead of relying solely on `displayName`. This provides a more consistent and explicit representation of user names.

**Activities**:

1.  **Backend Updates (`backend/routers/reports.py`)**:
    *   Modified the `UserReportEntry` Pydantic model to include `firstName: Optional[str]` and `lastName: Optional[str]`.
    *   Updated the `/api/reports/users-list` endpoint to fetch and populate `firstName` and `lastName` for each user from Firestore. The `displayName` field was kept for flexibility.
    *   **Commit**: Part of `900152e`.

2.  **Frontend Interface Update (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)**:
    *   Updated the `UserReportEntry` TypeScript interface to include `firstName?: string | null` and `lastName?: string | null`.
    *   **Commit**: Part of `900152e`.

3.  **Frontend Component Update (`frontend/src/components/reports/UsersReportSection.tsx`)**:
    *   Changed the first column's header from "Display Name" to "Full Name".
    *   Implemented an `accessorFn` for the "Full Name" column to compute the value as `` `${row.firstName || ''} ${row.lastName || ''}`.trim() || row.displayName || 'N/A' ``.
    *   The cell rendering logic was updated similarly.
    *   Added a custom `fullNameFilterFn` to enable filtering on the combined full name.
    *   Adjusted the CSV export logic to correctly derive the "Full Name" header and export the combined name value.
    *   **Commit**: Part of `900152e`.

**Overall Commit**:
*   **Commit ID**: `900152e`
*   **Commit Message**: "Refactor: Change Display Name to Full Name in Users Report. Updated the Users Report to display 'Full Name' (constructed from firstName and lastName) instead of 'Display Name'. Backend ('backend/routers/reports.py'): Added 'firstName' and 'lastName' fields to the 'UserReportEntry' Pydantic model. The '/api/reports/users-list' endpoint now populates these fields from user documents. 'displayName' is still included for flexibility. Frontend ('frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx'): Updated the 'UserReportEntry' TypeScript interface to include 'firstName' and 'lastName'. Frontend ('frontend/src/components/reports/UsersReportSection.tsx'): The first column in the users table is now 'Full Name'. Cell rendering logic combines 'firstName' and 'lastName', falling back to 'displayName' if the full name is not available. Implemented a custom 'fullNameFilterFn' for this column to allow filtering based on the combined full name. Updated CSV export to correctly include the 'Full Name' column. This change provides a more consistent and explicit representation of user names in the report."

**Next Steps**:
- Test the "Full Name" column thoroughly, including filtering, sorting, and CSV export, especially with users who might have missing `firstName`, `lastName`, or `displayName`.

## Session (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
**Goal**: Add a users table with filtering and export capabilities to the reports page.

**Summary**:
Successfully added a new "Users Overview" section to the Reports Dashboard. This involved creating a new backend endpoint to serve user data (including role names) and a new frontend component to display this data in a filterable, sortable, and exportable table.

**Activities**:

**Phase 1: Backend Development (`backend/routers/reports.py`)**
1.  **Defined Pydantic Models**:
    *   `UserReportEntry`: Represents a single user with fields: `id`, `displayName`, `email`, `assignedRoleNames` (list of strings), `status`, `createdAt`.
    *   `UsersReport`: Contains `data: List[UserReportEntry]` and `totalUsers: int`.
2.  **Created API Endpoint (`/api/reports/users-list`)**:
    *   Protected by `require_permission("admin", "view_summary")`.
    *   Fetches all users from the "users" collection, ordered by `createdAt` descending.
    *   For each user, retrieves `assignedRoleIds`.
    *   Efficiently fetches all unique role names in batches using `asyncio.gather` to avoid N+1 queries for role names.
    *   Constructs and returns a `UsersReport` containing a list of `UserReportEntry` objects.
    *   Handles potential string-to-datetime conversion for `createdAt`.
    *   Defaults user `status` to "active" if not present.
    *   **Bug Fix (Commit `55dea40`)**: Corrected `AttributeError: module 'google.cloud.firestore' has no attribute 'FieldPath'` by changing import to `from google.cloud.firestore_v1.field_path import FieldPath`.
    *   **Bug Fix (Commit `e0d7d8d`)**: Corrected logic to use `role_doc_snap.id` (which is `roleName`) as the role name instead of trying to access a non-existent `name` field from `role_data`.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development**
3.  **Updated Report Page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)**:
    *   Defined corresponding TypeScript interfaces: `UserReportEntry`, `UsersReport`.
    *   Added state variables: `usersReport` and `loadingUsersReport`.
    *   Updated `useEffect` to fetch data from `/api/reports/users-list` and manage loading/error states.
    *   Added a new `<UsersReportSection />` component to the JSX, passing the fetched data and loading state.
    *   Adjusted overall loading logic and helper functions for managing loader states.
4.  **Created New Component (`frontend/src/components/reports/UsersReportSection.tsx`)**:
    *   Receives `report: UsersReport | null`, `isLoading: boolean`, and `error?: string | null` as props.
    *   Uses `@tanstack/react-table` to display users.
    *   **Columns**: Display Name, Email, Roles (comma-separated), Status (styled with colored badges), Created At (formatted), User ID.
    *   **Filtering**: Implemented global "fuzzy" text search.
    *   **Enhancement (Commit `4f919a6`)**: Added per-column filter inputs to table headers for most columns.
    *   **Refactor (Commit `740b9e6`)**: Removed the "User ID" column from the table display and CSV export.
    *   **Sorting**: Enabled for all columns.
    *   **CSV Export**: Added a button to export the current table view (respecting filters) to `users_report.csv`.
    *   Handles loading, error, and "no data" states. Displays total user count.

**Phase 3: Finalization**
5.  **Committed Changes**:
    *   Initial feature commit: `fe6cd2e`.
    *   Subsequent fix/enhancement commits: `55dea40`, `e0d7d8d`, `4f919a6`, `740b9e6`.

**Next Steps**:
- Thoroughly test the Users Report section, including filtering (global and per-column), sorting, CSV export, and behavior with various data scenarios.
- Review UI/UX for clarity and usability.

## Session (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
**Goal**: Debug runtime error in `DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.

**Summary**:
A runtime error "Error: dateString is undefined" was reported in `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx` at line 120, where `parseISO(dateValue)` was called. This indicated `dateValue` (obtained from `info.getValue()`) was undefined.

**Activities**:
1.  **File Path Correction**: Initially attempted to read `src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`, which failed. Corrected path to `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.
2.  **Code Analysis**: Reviewed the provided code for `DonationInsightsSection.tsx`. The error occurred in the `cell` renderer for the `dateReceived` column definition.
3.  **Bug Fix**: Modified the `cell` renderer for `dateReceived` to:
    *   Get `dateValue` from `info.getValue()`.
    *   Check if `dateValue` is a string and not empty before attempting `parseISO`.
    *   If `dateValue` is invalid or not a string, display 'N/A'.
    *   This prevents `parseISO` from being called with an undefined value.
4.  **File Update**: Wrote the corrected code back to `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.
5.  **Commit**: Staged all changes and committed them.
    *   **Commit ID**: `984f9d8`
    *   **Commit Message Used**: "Fix: Handle undefined dateValue in DonationInsightsSection. The 'dateReceived' field in ReportDonationEntry could sometimes be undefined, leading to a runtime error when parseISO was called with an undefined value. This commit modifies the cell renderer for the 'dateReceived' column in frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx. It now checks if dateValue is a valid string before attempting to parse it. If dateValue is not a string or is empty, it defaults to displaying 'N/A', preventing the error and improving robustness."
    *   **Actual Changes in Commit**:
        *   **Backend (`backend/routers/reports.py`, `backend/uv.lock`)**:
            *   Major refactoring of reporting endpoints, now prefixed with `/api/reports`.
            *   New endpoints: `/admin-summary`, `/volunteer-activity`, `/event-performance`, `/donation-insights`.
            *   New Pydantic models for structured report responses.
            *   Updated permissions for report endpoints (requiring 'admin' role, 'view_summary' privilege).
            *   Enhanced data fetching, filtering (by period/date range), and error handling for reports.
            *   Updated `cryptography` (44.0.3 -> 45.0.2) and `pluggy` (1.5.0 -> 1.6.0).
        *   **Frontend (`frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json`, new files)**:
            *   Added new dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`.
            *   Created new main reports page: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`. This page fetches data from the new backend report endpoints and displays summary cards and sections for different reports.
            *   Created new report section components:
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`: Displays donation breakdown (pie chart), monetary trends (line chart), and recent donations (table with CSV export). Includes the bug fix for `dateReceived`.
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/EventPerformanceSection.tsx`: Displays event participation (bar chart) and detailed table (with CSV export).
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/VolunteerActivitySection.tsx`: Displays top volunteers (bar chart) and activity details (table with CSV export).
            *   Implemented loading states, error handling, and permission checks on the reports page.
    *   **Note on Commit Message**: The commit message accurately described the specific bug fix but did not encompass the full scope of the extensive feature additions (new reporting dashboard and backend infrastructure) included in the same commit.

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor application for any further issues related to date handling or the new reporting features.
- Consider amending the commit message of `984f9d8` if a more descriptive history is desired, or ensure future large commits have comprehensive messages.
