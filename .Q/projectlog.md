**Goal:** Beautify the Working Groups page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Refined Page Structure:**
    *   Removed redundant `<main>` tags from the component. The page content now directly resides within the `DashboardLayout`'s main content area.

2.  **Enhanced Page Header:**
    *   Added a Material Icon (`group_add`) to the "New Working Group" button.
    *   Ensured the button's classes (`py-2 px-4 bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm inline-flex items-center`) align with the styling guide.

3.  **Improved Working Group Card Design:**
    *   Restructured card layout to include an icon section on the left (using `workspaces` Material Icon), similar to event cards.
    *   Applied `group` class to the card's `Link` and `group-hover:text-indigo-600 dark:group-hover:text-indigo-400` to the working group name for hover effects.
    *   Adjusted status badge padding to `py-1` (from `py-0.5`) for consistency.
    *   Capitalized the first letter of the status display text (e.g., "Active", "Archived").
    *   Ensured the metadata footer (creator, created date) is consistently positioned at the bottom of the card.

4.  **Refined Loading, Error, Access Denied, and Empty States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Replaced simple text with a Material Icon (`sync` with `animate-spin`) and styled text, consistent with other pages.
    *   **Error State:** Styled the error message as a standard alert box with an `error_outline` icon and a link to the dashboard.
    *   **Access Denied State:** Added a `lock` Material Icon to the "Access Denied" title and an `arrow_back` icon to the "Go to Dashboard" button.
    *   **Empty State:** Enhanced the "No working groups found" message with a `workspaces_outline` Material Icon and improved text styling, consistent with other empty states.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency, adherence to the styling guide, and overall visual improvement.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

**Goal:** Update the styling guide to reflect the "no box" layout for page-level search/filter controls.

**Activities:**

1.  **Read Existing Styling Guide:** Loaded the content of `.Q/styling.md`.
2.  **Updated `.Q/styling.md`:**
    *   Added a new sub-point under Section 3 "Layout & Spacing" titled "**Page-Level Control Sections (e.g., Search/Filter Bars)**".
    *   This new point clarifies that such controls:
        *   Can optionally be enclosed in a styled card (e.g., `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6`).
        *   Alternatively, can be placed directly on the page background, typically using a grid and margins for spacing, as demonstrated in the recent Events page update.
    *   Noted that the existing "Search Bar Container" under Section 4 "Card Styling" is one implementation of the card-based approach for controls.

**Files Modified:**

*   `.Q/styling.md`
