# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Beautify the dashboard navigation bar.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed Styling Guide:** Read `.Q/styling.md` to understand the existing styling conventions.
2.  **Inspected `DashboardNav.tsx`:** Read the content of `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`.
3.  **Applied Styling Enhancements to `DashboardNav.tsx`:**
    *   Increased the font size of the "Fiji" brand link from `text-xl` to `text-2xl`.
    *   Updated navigation link styling:
        *   Set `text-sm font-medium`.
        *   Used `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` for base color.
        *   Used `hover:text-indigo-600 dark:hover:text-indigo-400` for hover color.
        *   Added `transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out` for smoother hover effect.
    *   Removed the `|` separators between navigation links and replaced them with `space-x-4` on the parent `div` for consistent spacing.
    *   Adjusted the logout button padding from `py-2 px-3` to `py-2 px-4` to match the primary button style in the guide.
    *   Styled the "Loading navigation..." text to `text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`.
    *   Simplified the logic for rendering navigation links by directly mapping over the `navLinks` array instead of using `forEach` and `push` to a separate `renderedNavItems` array. (This was an implicit improvement during refactoring for clarity).

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.
