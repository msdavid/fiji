## Session: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}} (Sprint 4 Manual Testing & Debugging)

**Goal:** Conduct manual testing for Sprint 4 features and address any bugs found.

**Activities:**
*   **Debugging `AttributeError` in `rbac.py`**:
    *   Identified missing `await` for Firestore calls in `get_current_user_with_rbac`.
    *   Updated `backend/dependencies/rbac.py` to make `get_current_user_with_rbac` and `_permission_checker` async, and added `await` for Firestore operations.
*   **Debugging Pydantic Validation Error for `EventWithSignupStatus` and `AttributeError` in `users.py`**:
    *   Identified `eventId` vs `id` mismatch between Pydantic models and router data construction for events.
    *   Updated `backend/models/event.py`: Changed `eventId` to `id` in `EventInDB`, `EventResponse`, `EventWithSignupStatus`. Changed `location` to `venue`.
    *   Identified missing `await` for Firestore calls and incorrect `firestore.Client` type hint in `backend/routers/users.py`.
    *   Updated `backend/routers/users.py` to use `await` for all Firestore calls and `firestore.AsyncClient`.
*   **Debugging Frontend Key Prop Warning and "Event not found" for Assignments**:
    *   Identified `eventId` vs `id` and `location` vs `venue` mismatch in `Event` interface in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`. Updated interface and usage.
    *   Refined `fetchEventAssignments` in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx` to improve reliability of `eventId` used.
*   **Debugging "Create New Event" Button Visibility**:
    *   Identified that frontend `UserProfile` in `AuthContext` was missing `is_sysadmin` and `privileges`.
    *   Simplified privilege check in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` to rely on `assignedRoleIds.includes('sysadmin')` for `SysAdminUser` to see "Create New Event" and "Edit" buttons as an interim solution.
*   **Sprint 4 Test Plan Execution Initiated**:
    *   Reviewed prerequisites from `tmp/sprint-4-test-plan.md`.
    *   Used `backend/utils/create-role.py` to create `event_manager` and `volunteer_basic` roles in Firestore.
    *   Currently awaiting user to confirm setup of users with these roles and creation of test events before proceeding with EP.1.

**Files Modified/Created (during this session for debugging & test prep):**
*   `backend/dependencies/rbac.py`
*   `backend/models/event.py`
*   `backend/routers/users.py`
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`
*   `.Q/projectlog.md` (this update)

**Next Steps:**
*   User to confirm prerequisites for Sprint 4 testing are met (users assigned roles, test events created).
*   Continue with manual execution of test cases from `tmp/sprint-4-test-plan.md`, starting with EP.1.

## Session: {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}} (Current Session) - Create Dashboard Navigation Menu & Refactor Pages

**Goal:** Create a reusable navigation menu for the user dashboard section and refactor relevant pages to use it, removing redundant navigation elements.

**Activities:**
*   Identified that the dashboard navigation was previously part of the main dashboard page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
*   Proposed and implemented a refactor to extract navigation into a dedicated component and a new dashboard layout file.
*   Created `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx` to house the navigation logic and links.
    *   Navigation links include: My Profile, Users (admin), Working Groups (admin), Events (all users).
    *   Includes user email display and logout button.
*   Created `frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to serve as the layout for all `/dashboard/*` routes.
    *   This layout imports and renders `DashboardNav`.
    *   It centralizes authentication checks (loading, error, redirect to login if not authenticated) for the dashboard section.
*   Modified `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to remove the embedded navigation and rely on the new `DashboardLayout`.
*   Identified and removed redundant `<nav>` elements and outer layout `divs` from:
    *   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`
    *   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx`
*   Adjusted the "New Working Group" button placement in `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx` for consistency.

**Files Modified/Created:**
*   `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx` (created)
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` (created)
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (modified)
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` (modified)
*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx` (modified)
*   `.Q/projectlog.md` (this update)

**Next Steps:**
*   User to test the updated dashboard pages to ensure single navigation and correct layout.
*   Proceed with further development or testing as instructed.
