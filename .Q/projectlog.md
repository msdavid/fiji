# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Implement a modern avatar dropdown for user profile, preferences, and logout in the dashboard navigation bar.

**Activities:**

1.  **Modified `DashboardNav.tsx` Structure:**
    *   Imported `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` from React.
    *   Added `isDropdownOpen` state (default `false`).
    *   Added `dropdownRef` to detect outside clicks.
    *   Created basic JSX for an avatar button (using Material Icon `person` or user's first initial) and an empty dropdown container.
    *   Styled the avatar button with `bg-indigo-100 dark:bg-indigo-800` and hover states.
    *   Added initial structure for dropdown items: "Signed in as", "Your Profile", "Preferences", "Logout".

2.  **Implemented Dropdown Functionality:**
    *   Added `useEffect` hook to listen for `mousedown` events.
    *   Implemented `handleClickOutside` function to set `isDropdownOpen` to `false` if a click occurs outside `dropdownRef.current`.
    *   The event listener is added when `isDropdownOpen` is true and removed otherwise, and also cleaned up on component unmount.
    *   Ensured `setIsDropdownOpen(false)` is called on navigation link clicks and after logout.

3.  **Styled Avatar and Dropdown Menu:**
    *   Refined avatar styling: `w-10 h-10`, rounded, appropriate background and text colors.
    *   Styled dropdown container: `origin-top-right absolute right-0 mt-2 w-56 rounded-md shadow-xl bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 ring-1 ring-gray-200 dark:ring-gray-700 z-50`.
    *   Styled dropdown sections: header with user info, menu items with appropriate padding, text colors, and hover states (`hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700`).
    *   Added Material Icons (`account_circle`, `settings`, `logout`) to respective menu items with `mr-2` for spacing.
    *   Enhanced icon hover effects using `group` and `group-hover` utilities.

4.  **Integrated Navigation Items into Dropdown:**
    *   The "Profile" link (`/dashboard/profile`) was moved into the dropdown.
    *   The "Logout" button and its `handleLogout` functionality were moved into the dropdown.
    *   A new "Preferences" link (`/dashboard/preferences`) was added to the dropdown as a placeholder.
    *   All links within the dropdown call `setIsDropdownOpen(false)` on click.

5.  **Corrected Build Error:**
    *   Fixed a syntax error in `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx` where an underscore was incorrectly placed in a `catch` block (`catch (error)_ {` changed to `catch (error) {`).

6.  **Final Review and Adjustments:**
    *   Confirmed basic responsiveness.
    *   Reviewed ARIA attributes for accessibility (`aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-labelledby`, `role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`).
    *   Verified styling consistency with the project's guide.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

**Goal:** Beautify the dashboard navigation bar.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed Styling Guide:** Read `.Q/styling.md` to understand the existing styling conventions.
2.  **Inspected `DashboardNav.tsx`:** Read the content of `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`.
3.  **Applied Styling Enhancements to `DashboardNav.tsx`:**
    *   Increased the font size of the "Fiji" brand link from `text-xl` to `text-2xl`.
    *   Updated navigation link styling:
        *   Set `text-sm font-medium`.
        *   Used `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` for base color.
        *   Used `hover:text-indigo-600 dark:hover:text-indigo-400` for hover color.
        *   Added `transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out` for smoother hover effect.
    *   Removed the `|` separators between navigation links and replaced them with `space-x-4` on the parent `div` for consistent spacing.
    *   Adjusted the logout button padding from `py-2 px-3` to `py-2 px-4` to match the primary button style in the guide.
    *   Styled the "Loading navigation..." text to `text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`.
    *   Simplified the logic for rendering navigation links by directly mapping over the `navLinks` array instead of using `forEach` and `push` to a separate `renderedNavItems` array. (This was an implicit improvement during refactoring for clarity).

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`
