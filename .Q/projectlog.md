# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Beautify the Events page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Refined Page Structure and Overall Layout:**
    *   Removed the redundant `<main>` tag from `events/page.tsx` as `DashboardLayout` provides it.
    *   Ensured the primary `div` in `events/page.tsx` acts as the direct content container.
    *   Adjusted the event card Link to use `flex-col` for its main layout and an inner `flex-row` for the icon and text content, with the metadata footer moved to be a direct child of the main `Link` component to ensure it's always at the bottom of the card.

2.  **Enhanced Header and Controls:**
    *   Added a Material Icon (`add_circle_outline`) to the "Create New Event" button.
    *   Updated the button's classes to `py-2 px-4 bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm inline-flex items-center` to align with the styling guide.
    *   Wrapped the search input and status filter in a styled container: `div className="mb-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6"`.

3.  **Improved Event Card Visuals:**
    *   Adjusted status badge padding on event cards from `py-0.5` to `py-1` (with existing `px-2`) to better align with the `px-2.5 py-1` guide suggestion for `Status Badges`.

4.  **Enhanced Loading and Empty States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Replaced simple text with a Material Icon (`sync`) with `animate-spin`, centered with improved text: `div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center h-full min-h-[300px]"`.
    *   **Empty State:** Added a Material Icon (`event_busy`) to the "No events found" message container. Enhanced container styling with `shadow-lg` and `flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-[200px]`. Improved text presentation with larger font for the main message and styled "create one now" link.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency with the styling guide and overall visual appeal.
    *   Confirmed input field padding (`p-3`) aligns with the guide.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

**Goal:** Update the styling guide with the new dashboard navigation bar and avatar dropdown styles.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed `DashboardNav.tsx`:** Re-read the component to accurately capture all relevant Tailwind CSS classes for the navigation bar, main links, avatar button, and dropdown menu.
2.  **Read Existing Styling Guide:** Loaded the content of `.Q/styling.md`.
3.  **Updated `.Q/styling.md`:**
    *   Added a new sub-section under "Specific Component Patterns" titled "**Navigation Bar (`DashboardNav.tsx`)**".

        *   The main `nav` container and its inner layout.
        *   The brand link.
        *   The area for navigation links and individual link styling.
    *   Detailed the **Avatar Dropdown** structure and styling:
        *   Avatar button (referenced a new entry under "Buttons" section).
        *   Dropdown panel (positioning, background, shadow, ring).
        *   Header section within the dropdown (padding, border, text styles for "Signed in as" and user display name).
        *   Menu item sections and individual menu items (links and buttons).
        *   Styling for standard and destructive menu items, including hover states.
    *   Added a specific entry for "**Avatar Button (Navbar)**" under Section 5 "Buttons".
    *   Updated Section 6 "Icons (Material Icons)" to include "**Dropdown Menu Item Icons**" with variants for standard and destructive items, including `group-hover` effects.
    *   Adjusted existing color palette entries (e.g., Primary Indigo hover, Destructive Red text/backgrounds, Neutral Backgrounds/Text) to reflect usage in the dropdown menu and its items.
    *   Updated typography section to include "Navbar Brand Link" and "Navbar Links" styles.
