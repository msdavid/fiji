# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Add a "Delete Working Group" button and functionality to the View Working Group (Detail) page.

**Activities:**

1.  **Permission Check:**
    *   Added `canDelete` state variable based on user profile privileges (`working_groups`, `delete` or `sysadmin`).

2.  **State Variables:**
    *   Added `isDeleting` (boolean) to track deletion progress.
    *   Added `deleteError` (string | null) to store errors from the delete operation.

3.  **`handleDeleteWorkingGroup` Function:**
    *   Created an asynchronous function to handle the deletion logic.
    *   Includes a confirmation dialog (`confirm(...)`) before proceeding.
    *   Sets `isDeleting` to `true` and clears `deleteError`.
    *   Makes a `DELETE` request to `/working-groups/{groupId}` with the Firebase auth token.
    *   On success (204 or 200), navigates to `/dashboard/admin/working-groups`.
    *   On failure, sets `deleteError` with the error message from the backend.
    *   Resets `isDeleting` to `false` in a `finally` block.

4.  **UI Integration:**
    *   Added a "Delete Working Group" button within the main info card, below the `DetailItem` components and before the "Manage Members" section.
    *   The button is conditionally rendered based on the `canDelete` permission.
    *   Styled the button as a destructive action button: `py-2 px-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm inline-flex items-center disabled:opacity-50`, with a `delete_forever` icon.
    *   The button's text changes to "Deleting..." and is disabled when `isDeleting` is true.
    *   Added a section to display `deleteError` messages if they occur, styled as a red alert box.
    *   Adjusted the top margin/border for the "Manage Members" section to ensure proper spacing whether the delete button section is present or not.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Beautify the View Working Group (Detail) page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Standardized Page Layout:**
    *   Removed custom padding and max-width from the `<main>` tag, assuming future integration with `DashboardLayout`.
    *   Ensured the "Back to Working Groups" link uses `arrow_back_ios` icon for consistency.

2.  **Enhanced Main Information Display (Top Card):**
    *   Added a `workspaces` Material Icon next to the working group name.
    *   Adjusted status badge padding to `px-2.5 py-1`.
    *   Restructured "Description", "Created By", "Created On", and "Last Updated" details using a local `DetailItem` helper component (mimicking styling guide) for better visual organization with icons.

3.  **Improved "Manage Members" Section:**
    *   **Assign User Form:**
        *   Styled the form container with `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm`.
        *   Styled the "Assign User" button as a primary green "Success" button with a `person_add` icon.
    *   **Current Members List:**
        *   Styled the "Remove" button as a "Small/Action (Destructive Red)" button with a `person_remove` icon.
        *   Improved display of user email/ID and assignment date.
        *   Added a loading indicator for when members are being fetched.

4.  **Refined Loading, Error, and Access Denied States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Implemented the standard animated `sync` icon and styled text.
    *   **Error States:**
        *   Main working group fetch error and "Not Found" states are now full-page messages with icons (`error_outline`, `search_off`) and styled containers.
        *   Assignment-related errors (`assignmentsError`) are displayed within the "Manage Members" section, using an alert box style if appropriate.
    *   **Access Denied State:** Enhanced with a `lock` icon for the title and an `arrow_back` icon for the button.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Added a local `DetailItem` helper component for structured detail display.
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency with the styling guide and overall visual improvement.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`
