### Sprint: Authentication Enhancements

**Task: Implement "Forgot Password" Functionality**

*   **Objective:** Add a "Forgot Password" feature to the frontend login page, leveraging Firebase Authentication's password reset capabilities.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`:
        *   Imported `sendPasswordResetEmail` from `firebase/auth`.
        *   Added state variables (`resetEmail`, `resetMessage`, `resetError`, `showResetForm`) to manage the UI and logic for password reset.
        *   Integrated a "Forgot your password?" link/button that toggles visibility between the login form and a new password reset form.
        *   The password reset form collects the user's email.
        *   Implemented `handlePasswordReset` async function:
            *   Calls `sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, resetEmail)` to trigger Firebase's password reset email flow.
            *   Provides user feedback (success or error messages) based on the outcome.
            *   Includes error handling for common Firebase errors like `auth/user-not-found` and `auth/invalid-email`.
        *   Added a "Back to Login" link on the reset form.
        *   Styled the new elements to be consistent with the existing login page.
*   **Backend Impact:** None. Password reset is handled client-side via Firebase.
*   **Outcome:** The login page now includes a mechanism for users to request a password reset email through Firebase.

**Previously in this session:**
*   Analyzed frontend login mechanism (`frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` and `frontend/src/lib/firebaseConfig.ts`).
*   Analyzed backend authentication router (`backend/routers/auth.py`) and token verification dependency (`backend/dependencies/auth.py`).
*   Confirmed that the frontend handles direct authentication with Firebase, and the backend verifies Firebase ID tokens for API requests.
