# Project Log

## Session 2024-07-29 (Continued)

*   **Refactored Event Models and Endpoints (Backend & Frontend)** (This was a previous, reverted effort)
    *   **Goal:** Add `point_of_contact` to events and align models with a more robust structure.
    *   **Backend (`backend/models/event.py`):**
        *   Added `point_of_contact: Optional[str]` to `Event`, `EventCreate`, `EventUpdate`.
        *   Significantly refactored `Event` model:
            *   Renamed fields: `eventName` to `name`, `dateTime` to `date`, `venue` to `location`.
            *   Replaced `organizerUserId: Optional[str]` with `organizer_ids: List[str]`.
            *   Replaced `volunteersRequired: Optional[int]` with `max_attendees: Optional[int]`.
            *   Removed `eventType`, `purpose`, `endTime`.
            *   Added new fields: `participant_ids: List[str]`, `working_group_id: Optional[str]`, `is_public: bool`, `tags: Optional[List[str]]`, `registration_deadline: Optional[datetime]`, `banner_image_url: Optional[HttpUrl]`.
            *   Standardized status values (e.g., "planned", "ongoing", "completed", "cancelled").
        *   Re-defined `EventResponse` and `EventWithSignupStatus` to inherit from the new `Event` structure and include necessary fields for API responses.
    *   **Backend (`backend/routers/events.py`):**
        *   Updated all event CRUD endpoints (`create_event`, `list_events`, `get_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`) to use the new Pydantic models (`EventCreate`, `EventUpdate`, `EventResponse`, `EventWithSignupStatus`).
        *   Adjusted logic for field name changes (e.g., `name`, `date`, `location`).
        *   Modified handling of organizers to support `organizer_ids` list (basic validation, TODOs for full name resolution in responses).
        *   Removed logic related to `endTime`.
        *   Updated event signup endpoint (`self_signup_for_event`) to check against new status values (e.g., "planned" instead of "open_for_signup", needs functional verification).
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/new/page.tsx` - Create Event Form):**
        *   Updated `EventFormData` interface and `initialFormData` to match new backend `EventCreate` model (added `point_of_contact`, `name`, `date`, `location`, `organizer_ids`, `max_attendees`, `is_public`, `tags`, `registration_deadline`, `working_group_id`, `banner_image_url`; removed/renamed old fields).
        *   Modified form JSX to include new input fields and update existing ones.
        *   Updated `handleChange` and `handleSubmit` to manage new fields and send correct payload.
        *   Adjusted organizer selection to handle `organizer_ids` (currently supports one, UI can be extended).
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit Event Form):**
        *   Updated `EventFormData` interface to align with new backend `EventUpdate` model.
        *   Added/modified input fields in JSX.
        *   Updated `fetchEventData` to correctly map and populate form with data from the new `Event` structure.
        *   Updated `handleSubmit` to send the correct update payload.
        *   Adjusted organizer selection and display.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx` - Event Detail Page):**
        *   Updated `Event` interface to match the new backend `EventResponse` model.
        *   Modified display logic to show `point_of_contact` and other new/changed fields (e.g., `name`, `date`, `location`, `organizer_ids` via fetched names).
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` - Event List Page):**
        *   Updated `Event` interface to match the new backend `EventResponse` model for consistency.
        *   Updated event card display to use new field names (`name`, `date`, `location`).
        *   `point_of_contact` was not added to the card display to keep it concise.
        *   Adjusted dynamic status logic and status filtering to align with new status values.

*   Added `point_of_contact` field to the `Event` model (`backend/models/event.py`). (Initial commit for this feature during the reverted refactor)
    *   Updated `Event`, `EventCreate`, and `EventUpdate` Pydantic models.
*   **Reverted commit `458d41a`**: "Revert \"fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events\"". This undid changes related to temporary data mapping for legacy events.
*   **Reverted commit `e910580`**: "Revert \"Revert \\"fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events\\"\"". This re-applied the changes from "fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events" by undoing the previous revert.
*   **Reverted commit `d94b380`**: "Revert \"Revert \\"Revert \\"fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events\\"\\"\"". This again undid the changes from "fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events" by undoing the previous revert.
*   **Performed `git reset --hard 348302f`**: Discarded 6 commits made after `348302f` ("feat: Enhance event cards with dynamic ongoing status and UI refinements"). HEAD is now at `348302f`. The discarded commits were:
    *   `39d277e` - feat: Add point_of_contact to Event model
    *   `e2131b8` - refactor: Align event models and UI with new structure
    *   `df20fea` - fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events
    *   `458d41a` - Revert "fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events"
    *   `e910580` - Revert "Revert "fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events""
    *   `d94b380` - Revert "Revert "Revert "fix: Add temporary data mapping for legacy events"""
