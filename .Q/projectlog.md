# Project Log - Fiji

## Session (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
**Goal**: Debug runtime error in `DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.

**Summary**:
A runtime error "Error: dateString is undefined" was reported in `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx` at line 120, where `parseISO(dateValue)` was called. This indicated `dateValue` (obtained from `info.getValue()`) was undefined.

**Activities**:
1.  **File Path Correction**: Initially attempted to read `src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`, which failed. Corrected path to `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.
2.  **Code Analysis**: Reviewed the provided code for `DonationInsightsSection.tsx`. The error occurred in the `cell` renderer for the `dateReceived` column definition.
3.  **Bug Fix**: Modified the `cell` renderer for `dateReceived` to:
    *   Get `dateValue` from `info.getValue()`.
    *   Check if `dateValue` is a string and not empty before attempting `parseISO`.
    *   If `dateValue` is invalid or not a string, display 'N/A'.
    *   This prevents `parseISO` from being called with an undefined value.
4.  **File Update**: Wrote the corrected code back to `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`.
5.  **Commit**: Staged all changes and committed them.
    *   **Commit ID**: `984f9d8`
    *   **Commit Message Used**: "Fix: Handle undefined dateValue in DonationInsightsSection. The 'dateReceived' field in ReportDonationEntry could sometimes be undefined, leading to a runtime error when parseISO was called with an undefined value. This commit modifies the cell renderer for the 'dateReceived' column in frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx. It now checks if dateValue is a valid string before attempting to parse it. If dateValue is not a string or is empty, it defaults to displaying 'N/A', preventing the error and improving robustness."
    *   **Actual Changes in Commit**:
        *   **Backend (`backend/routers/reports.py`, `backend/uv.lock`)**:
            *   Major refactoring of reporting endpoints, now prefixed with `/api/reports`.
            *   New endpoints: `/admin-summary`, `/volunteer-activity`, `/event-performance`, `/donation-insights`.
            *   New Pydantic models for structured report responses.
            *   Updated permissions for report endpoints (requiring 'admin' role, 'view_summary' privilege).
            *   Enhanced data fetching, filtering (by period/date range), and error handling for reports.
            *   Updated `cryptography` (44.0.3 -> 45.0.2) and `pluggy` (1.5.0 -> 1.6.0).
        *   **Frontend (`frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json`, new files)**:
            *   Added new dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`.
            *   Created new main reports page: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`. This page fetches data from the new backend report endpoints and displays summary cards and sections for different reports.
            *   Created new report section components:
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/DonationInsightsSection.tsx`: Displays donation breakdown (pie chart), monetary trends (line chart), and recent donations (table with CSV export). Includes the bug fix for `dateReceived`.
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/EventPerformanceSection.tsx`: Displays event participation (bar chart) and detailed table (with CSV export).
                *   `frontend/src/components/reports/VolunteerActivitySection.tsx`: Displays top volunteers (bar chart) and activity details (table with CSV export).
            *   Implemented loading states, error handling, and permission checks on the reports page.
    *   **Note on Commit Message**: The commit message accurately described the specific bug fix but did not encompass the full scope of the extensive feature additions (new reporting dashboard and backend infrastructure) included in the same commit.

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor application for any further issues related to date handling or the new reporting features.
- Consider amending the commit message of `984f9d8` if a more descriptive history is desired, or ensure future large commits have comprehensive messages.
