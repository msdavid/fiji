**Goal:** Beautify the View Working Group (Detail) page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Standardized Page Layout:**
    *   Removed custom padding and max-width from the `<main>` tag, assuming future integration with `DashboardLayout`.
    *   Ensured the "Back to Working Groups" link uses `arrow_back_ios` icon for consistency.

2.  **Enhanced Main Information Display (Top Card):**
    *   Added a `workspaces` Material Icon next to the working group name.
    *   Adjusted status badge padding to `px-2.5 py-1`.
    *   Restructured "Description", "Created By", "Created On", and "Last Updated" details using a local `DetailItem` helper component (mimicking styling guide) for better visual organization with icons.

3.  **Improved "Manage Members" Section:**
    *   **Assign User Form:**
        *   Styled the form container with `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm`.
        *   Styled the "Assign User" button as a primary green "Success" button with a `person_add` icon.
    *   **Current Members List:**
        *   Styled the "Remove" button as a "Small/Action (Destructive Red)" button with a `person_remove` icon.
        *   Improved display of user email/ID and assignment date.
        *   Added a loading indicator for when members are being fetched.

4.  **Refined Loading, Error, and Access Denied States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Implemented the standard animated `sync` icon and styled text.
    *   **Error States:**
        *   Main working group fetch error and "Not Found" states are now full-page messages with icons (`error_outline`, `search_off`) and styled containers.
        *   Assignment-related errors (`assignmentsError`) are displayed within the "Manage Members" section, using an alert box style if appropriate.
    *   **Access Denied State:** Enhanced with a `lock` icon for the title and an `arrow_back` icon for the button.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Added a local `DetailItem` helper component for structured detail display.
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency with the styling guide and overall visual improvement.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.
*   Consider moving `DetailItem` to a shared component if it will be reused.

**Goal:** Beautify the Working Groups page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Refined Page Structure:**
    *   Removed redundant `<main>` tags from the component. The page content now directly resides within the `DashboardLayout`'s main content area.

2.  **Enhanced Page Header:**
    *   Added a Material Icon (`group_add`) to the "New Working Group" button.
    *   Ensured the button's classes (`py-2 px-4 bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm inline-flex items-center`) align with the styling guide.

3.  **Improved Working Group Card Design:**
    *   Restructured card layout to include an icon section on the left (using `workspaces` Material Icon), similar to event cards.
    *   Applied `group` class to the card's `Link` and `group-hover:text-indigo-600 dark:group-hover:text-indigo-400` to the working group name for hover effects.
    *   Adjusted status badge padding to `py-1` (from `py-0.5`) for consistency.
    *   Capitalized the first letter of the status display text (e.g., "Active", "Archived").
    *   Ensured the metadata footer (creator, created date) is consistently positioned at the bottom of the card.

4.  **Refined Loading, Error, Access Denied, and Empty States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Replaced simple text with a Material Icon (`sync` with `animate-spin`) and styled text, consistent with other pages.
    *   **Error State:** Styled the error message as a standard alert box with an `error_outline` icon and a link to the dashboard.
    *   **Access Denied State:** Added a `lock` Material Icon to the "Access Denied" title and an `arrow_back` icon to the "Go to Dashboard" button.
    *   **Empty State:** Enhanced the "No working groups found" message with a `workspaces_outline` Material Icon and improved text styling, consistent with other empty states.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency, adherence to the styling guide, and overall visual improvement.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/page.tsx`
