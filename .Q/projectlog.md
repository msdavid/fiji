# Project Log - Fiji Platform

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Update the styling guide to reflect the "no box" layout for page-level search/filter controls.

**Activities:**

1.  **Read Existing Styling Guide:** Loaded the content of `.Q/styling.md`.
2.  **Updated `.Q/styling.md`:**
    *   Added a new sub-point under Section 3 "Layout & Spacing" titled "**Page-Level Control Sections (e.g., Search/Filter Bars)**".
    *   This new point clarifies that such controls:
        *   Can optionally be enclosed in a styled card (e.g., `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6`).
        *   Alternatively, can be placed directly on the page background, typically using a grid and margins for spacing, as demonstrated in the recent Events page update.
    *   Noted that the existing "Search Bar Container" under Section 4 "Card Styling" is one implementation of the card-based approach for controls.

**Files Modified:**

*   `.Q/styling.md`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

## Session DATE_TIME_PLACEHOLDER

**Goal:** Remove the styled container ("box") from behind the search and filter controls on the Events page.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed `events/page.tsx`:** Identified the `div` element with classes `mb-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 md:p-6` that was acting as the container for the search and filter inputs.
2.  **Modified `events/page.tsx`:**
    *   Removed the aforementioned `div` element.
    *   The inner `div` with classes `mb-6 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` (which was previously a child) is now the direct container for the search and filter inputs, placing them directly on the page's main background. The `mb-6` class was retained on this grid container to maintain spacing.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx`
