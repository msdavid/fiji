**Goal:** Beautify the "Create New Working Group" page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/new/page.tsx`).

**Activities:**

1.  **Standardized Page Layout (Previous Step):**
    *   Removed custom navigation and page background, preparing for `DashboardLayout`.
    *   Added a styled "Back to Working Groups" link with an icon.

2.  **Refined Form Styling:**
    *   Ensured input fields (`input`, `textarea`, `select`) use `p-3` padding for consistency with the styling guide's "General Input" style.
    *   Styled the "Cancel" button as a secondary/outline button with a `cancel` icon.
    *   Styled the "Create Working Group" button as a primary button with an `add_circle_outline` icon.
    *   Implemented a loading state for the submit button, showing "Creating..." and an animated `sync` icon.

3.  **Enhanced Loading and Access Denied States:**
    *   **Loading State:** Replaced simple "Loading..." text with the standard animated Material Icon (`sync`) and styled text: `Loading page...`.
    *   **Access Denied State:** Improved styling to match other access denied messages, including a `lock` Material Icon and an `arrow_back` icon on the "Back to Working Groups" button.

4.  **Error Message Styling:**
    *   Styled the form error message (`{error && ...}`) using the standard alert box: `my-4 p-3 text-sm text-red-600 bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/30 rounded-lg flex items-center` with an `error_outline` icon.

5.  **Code Cleanup and Final Review:**
    *   Reviewed all changes for consistency with the styling guide and overall visual appeal.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/new/page.tsx`

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

**Goal:** Relocate the "Delete Working Group" button to the end of the card on the View Working Group (Detail) page.

**Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed `[groupId]/page.tsx`:** Analyzed the JSX structure.
2.  **Modified `[groupId]/page.tsx`:**
    *   Moved the "Actions" section (renamed to "Danger Zone") containing the "Delete Working Group" button to be the last element within the main content card (`div.bg-white.dark:bg-gray-900`).
    *   This places it after the "Manage Members" section.
    *   The "Danger Zone" section includes a title (`h3.text-xl.font-semibold`) and a small descriptive paragraph below the button.
    *   The `deleteError` display was also moved to appear just before the "Danger Zone" section if an error occurs during deletion.
    *   Removed the conditional top margin/border logic from the "Manage Members" section as the "Danger Zone" will always follow it if `canDelete` is true, or nothing will follow if `canDelete` is false and `canManageAssignments` is true. The "Manage Members" section will always have a top border if it's not the first section in the card after the main details.

**Files Modified:**

*   `frontend/src/app/dashboard/admin/working-groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`
